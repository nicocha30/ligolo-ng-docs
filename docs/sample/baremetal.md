# Ligolo-baremetal

!!! danger "Still in WIP!"

    Ligolo-baremetal is an experimental build of Ligolo-ng designed to run directly on embedded systems without any overlay (no operating system or kernel).

    The advantage is that you can deploy physical Ligolo-ng implants quickly and easily.

    This feature is still under development, but you can get some technical details by following the talk that took place at [DEFCON Paris](http://defconparis.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nicocha-CysLab-RedTeam.pdf)

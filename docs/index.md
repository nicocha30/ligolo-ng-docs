# Introduction

**Ligolo-ng** is a *simple*, *lightweight* and *fast* tool that allows pentesters to establish
tunnels from a reverse TCP/TLS connection using a **tun interface** (without the need of SOCKS).

## Features

- **Tun interface** (No more SOCKS!)
- Simple UI with *agent* selection and *network information*
- Easy to use and setup
- Automatic certificate configuration with Let's Encrypt
- Performant (Multiplexing)
- Does not require high privileges
- Socket listening/binding on the *agent*
- Multiple platforms supported for the *agent*
- Can handle multiple tunnels
- Reverse/Bind Connection

## How is this different from Ligolo/Chisel/Meterpreter... ?

Instead of using a SOCKS proxy or TCP/UDP forwarders, **Ligolo-ng** creates a userland network stack using [Gvisor](https://gvisor.dev/).

When running the *relay/proxy* server, a **tun** interface is used, packets sent to this interface are
translated, and then transmitted to the *agent* remote network.

As an example, for a TCP connection:

- SYN are translated to connect() on remote
- SYN-ACK is sent back if connect() succeed
- RST is sent if ECONNRESET, ECONNABORTED or ECONNREFUSED syscall are returned after connect
- Nothing is sent if timeout

This allows running tools like *nmap* without the use of *proxychains* (simpler and faster).

## Does it require Administrator/root access ?

On the *agent* side, no! Everything can be performed without administrative access.

However, on your *relay/proxy* server, you need to be able to create a *tun* interface.

## Supported protocols/packets

* TCP
* UDP
* ICMP (echo requests)

## Performance

You can easily hit more than 100 Mbits/sec. Here is a test using `iperf` from a 200Mbits/s server to a 200Mbits/s connection.
```shell
$ iperf3 -c 10.10.0.1 -p 24483

```

## Caveats

Because the *agent* is running without privileges, it's not possible to forward raw packets.
When you perform a NMAP SYN-SCAN, a TCP connect() is performed on the agent.

When using *nmap*, you should use `--unprivileged` or `-PE` to avoid false positives.
